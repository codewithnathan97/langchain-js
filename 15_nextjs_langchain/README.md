This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies using your favorite JavaScript package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Next, rename `.env.sample` as `.env` and input your API key there.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Happy Coding!
