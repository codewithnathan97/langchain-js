The code repository for the _LangChainJS For Beginners_ book by _Nathan Sebhastian_.

Before running the scripts, install the required dependencies using pip as shown below:

```sh
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the required API keys in the file.

Then, you can try running one of the scripts with python as follows:

```sh
node 02_Simple_Q\&A_Gemini/app_gemini.js
```

Chapter 15 and 16 are Next.js projects, so you need to install the dependencies of those projects separately.

Read the `README` file there to see further instructions.

Happy Coding!
